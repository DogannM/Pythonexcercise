#Simple Arithmetic
#Create a program that takes two numbers from the user and performs addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
var1 = input("Enter a number: ")
var2 = input("Enter another number: ")

if type(var1) is int and type(var2) is int == True :
    pass
else:
    print("Please enter a number")
    var1 = input("Enter a number not a string ! : ") 
    var2 = input("Enter another number not a string ! : ")

print("Addition: " + str(var1 + var2))
print("Subtraction: " + str(var1 - var2))
print("Multiplication: " + str(var1 * var2))
print("Division: " + str(var1 / var2))

#Odd or Even
#Write a program that asks the user for a number and prints whether it is odd or even.

#Basic Calculator
#Create a calculator that performs basic operations (add, subtract, multiply, divide) based on user input.
